  <p>You take no actions when it isn’t your turn. On your turn, your only
  actions are as follows: choose which of your melee attacks you want to use to
  attack. Then randomly select a nearby creature. You’ll do what you can to
  attack that creature, ally or enemy, with your chosen attack. If you need to
  move to attack your target, you can attempt to disengage instead of taking
  opportunity attacks, even twice if your first attempt fails. If a disengage
  check succeeds you move to engage your target.</p>
