  <p>When you attack a creature that’s vulnerable to that attack, you deal bonus
  damage equal to double your level as you attack. In other words, hit or miss,
  crit or fumble, deal bonus damage equal to double your level before applying
  any other damage from the attack. (<i>Exception</i>: Mooks and weaklings only
  deal damage equal to their level, not twice their level.)</p> <p>When you
  attack a creature that’s vulnerable to that attack, you deal bonus damage
  equal to double your level whether you hit or miss. If you score a critical
  hit, double that and deal bonus damage equal to 4 times your level! If you
  roll a 1 and fumble, you deal 0 damage as usual, vulnerable can’t help you
  when you fumble. (Exception: Mooks and weaklings only deal damage equal to
  their level, not twice their level.)</p> </p>As usual, a natural 1 fumble
  attack against a vulnerable target still deals no damage, and a critical hit
  against a vulnerable target doubles the bonus damage—in other words, a
  critical deals bonus damage equal to quadruple the attackers’ level.</p>
