        <p>When you attack a creature that’s vulnerable to that attack, you deal
        bonus damage equal to double your level as you attack. In other words,
        hit or miss, crit or fumble, deal bonus damage equal to double your
        level before applying any other damage from the attack.
        (<em>Exception</em>: Mooks and weaklings only deal damage equal to their
        level, not twice their level.)</p><p>As usual, a natural 1 fumble attack
        against a vulnerable target still deals no damage, and a critical hit
        against a vulnerable target doubles the bonus damage—in other words, a
        critical deals bonus damage equal to quadruple the attackers’
        level.</p><p></p>
