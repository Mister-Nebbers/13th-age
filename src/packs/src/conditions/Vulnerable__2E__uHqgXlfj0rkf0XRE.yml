  <p>When you attack a creature thatâ€™s
  vulnerable to that attack, you deal bonus
  damage equal to double your level as you
  attack. In other words, hit or miss, crit or
  fumble, deal bonus damage equal to double
  your level before applying any other damage
  from the attack. (<i>Exception</i>: Mooks and
  weaklings only deal damage equal to their
  level, not twice their level.)</p>
