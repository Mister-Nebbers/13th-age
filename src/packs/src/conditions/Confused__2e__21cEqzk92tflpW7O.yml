        <p>You’re uncertain what’s going on and what you should do. You take no
        actions when it isn’t your turn, such as making opportunity attacks or
        activating magic items. At the start of your turn, roll a [[/r d6]] to
        determine your only actions this turn.</p> <p><b>1-3</b>: Pick a random
        nearby ally. You do what you can to make a basic or at-will attack
        against that ally, though you can choose to disengage instead of
        triggering opportunity attacks for moving away from enemies;</p>
        <p><b>4-5</b>: You attempt to disengage from everyone you are engaged
        with, treating allies as if they were also enemies—'you can’t be too
        careful.’ You don’t move far, you’re just trying not to get hit;</p>
        <p><b>6+</b>: You take no actions on your turn, but at least you aren’t
        attacking an ally.</p>
