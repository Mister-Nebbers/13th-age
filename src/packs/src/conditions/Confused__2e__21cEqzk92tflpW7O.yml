  <p>You’re uncertain what’s going on and
  what you should do. You take no actions
  when it isn’t your turn, such as making
  opportunity attacks or activating magic items.
  At the start of your turn, roll a [[/r d6]] to determine
  your only actions this turn.</p>
  <p><b>1-3</b>: Pick a random nearby ally. You do what
  you can to make a basic or at-will attack
  against that ally, though you can choose to
  disengage instead of triggering opportunity
  attacks for moving away from enemies;</p>
  <p><b>4-5</b>: You attempt to disengage from everyone
  you are engaged with, treating allies as if they
  were also enemies—'you can’t be too careful.’
  You don’t move far, you’re just trying not to
  get hit;</p>
  <p><b>6+</b>: You take no actions on your turn, but at least
  you aren’t attacking an ally.</p>
