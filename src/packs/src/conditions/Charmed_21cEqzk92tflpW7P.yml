        <p>You can’t attack. The condition ends if you are attacked by an enemy.
        You can use your actions doing anything other than attacking, but for
        the moment it feels to you like there’s some sort of terrible
        misunderstanding between friends. You know who your allies, are and can
        take actions to help them, but you suspect that everyone else might be
        your allies also. You’re not as sure about the ‘friends’ who are
        actually enemies, so you don’t have to use your spells to heal them or
        act like they’re allies unless you’re personally into roleplaying
        comedy.</p>
