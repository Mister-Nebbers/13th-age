  <p>You can’t attack. The condition ends if
  you are attacked by an enemy. You can use
  your actions doing anything other than
  attacking, but for the moment it feels to you
  like there’s some sort of terrible
  misunderstanding between friends. You know
  who your allies, are and can take actions to
  help them, but you suspect that everyone else
  might be your allies also. You’re not as sure
  about the ‘friends’ who are actually enemies,
  so you don’t have to use your spells to heal
  them or act like they’re allies unless you’re
  personally into roleplaying comedy.</p>
