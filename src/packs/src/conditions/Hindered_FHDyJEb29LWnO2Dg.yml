  <p>You can’t cast spells, use powers (not
  even kin powers), use limited use abilities, or
  make attacks other than basic attacks. You can
  move normally but you can’t use limited use
  abilities or powers to move.</p>
  <p>This condition has a huge impact on spellcasters
  and monsters with powerful special abilities and
  less impact, though still appreciable, on
  creatures that rely on their basic attacks.</p>
  <p>For clarity’s sake, here are some things that
  characters and monsters have no problem doing
  when hindered:<p>
  <p>Drink a potion.</p>
  <p>Rally.</p>
  <p>Intercept; but not using the Skilled
  Interceptor fighter talent.</p>
  <p>Make an opportunity attack.</p>
  <p>Make a save.</p>
  <p>Heal if some other non-hindered character
  has healed them with a healing spell.</p>
  <p>Benefit from a kin power like the
  forgeborn’s rugged, a statistical adjustment to
  recovery dice that’s built into the hero rather
  than having to be activated or triggered or
  ‘used.’</p>
  <p>Deal automatic damage if they already have
  an enemy grabbed! (There could be an argument
  against this, but it seems OK to us.)</p>
  <p>Try to disengage.</p>
