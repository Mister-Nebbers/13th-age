        <p>When a monster that is grabbing you starts its turn, it deals
        automatic damage to you as a free action. The automatic damage is equal
        to half the normal damage that it deals with its basic melee
        attack.</p><p>You are engaged with the creature grabbing you, and you
        can't move away unless you teleport, pop free, or successfully
        disengage. You can't make opportunity attacks, but you can make normal
        attacks on your turn.</p><p>If you are smaller than the creature that is
        grabbing you, it can move and carry you along no problem. If you are the
        same size or larger, the creature grabbing you has to let go of you if
        it wants to move.</p>
