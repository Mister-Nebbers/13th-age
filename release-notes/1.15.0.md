# Release Notes 1.15.0

## Features

- Added compatibility for Foundry v9. If using Foundry 0.8.9, you'll need to
  continue using Toolkit13 1.14.0.
- Removed the v1 sheet. The v1 sheet had been kept around as a legacy sheet,
  but due the v2 sheet having a fallback in place for when the VuePort module
  is unavailable and due to new bugs creeping into the v1 sheet, it has been
  removed.

## Bug Fixes

- Resolved an issue with the damage applicator on tokens.
