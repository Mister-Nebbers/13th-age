## 2e Changes
- Rename `Iconic` to `Zenith`
- Fix barbarian base stats

## Bug Fixes
- Fix `Charmed` condition being wrongly titled `Confused` in its journal entry.
- [v12] Fixed remaining calls to `"data."` in actor and item update methods, which should hopefully be the last of the breaking v12 bugs. In particular, this fixes a bug where updates to a tokens resources from the token HUD wouldn't be saved.
- [v12] Fixed references to `{async: true}` in rolls. These were already being handled as async, but including the option caused a deprecation warning to appear.
