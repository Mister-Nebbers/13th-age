## Compatible Foundry versions

![Foundry v11.315](https://img.shields.io/badge/Foundry-v11.315-green) ![Foundry v12.327](https://img.shields.io/badge/Foundry-v12.327-green)

**Note**: This system update includes both support for Foundry v12 and the 13th Age 2e beta packet rules. Backup before updating!

## Foundry v12
Added support for Foundry v12 to the system. This was implemented in a way such that we didn't have to disable v11 support, so you'll still see warnings in your console for API calls that were deprecated as of v12. Those will go away in a future version when we will remove v11 support.

## 2e Beta Packet Support
We've added support for the 2e Beta Packet rules to the system! Currently, this is only _mechanical_ support. Unlike the alpha packet, we will eventually have compendium content to go along with the playable draft rules, but we're currently targeting the upcoming Gamma Packet rather than the Beta Packet for a backer-exclusive module. The system's eventual public version of the 2e compendium content will be dependent on the timeline of the final rules and their accompanying SRD.

- Updated NPC data structure and sheet to separate size from strength. This also includes a migration to update existing actors to use the new format.
- Updated NPC sheet header to wrap if it has too many properties (size, level, strength, etc.). This is most common for triple-strength aberrations due to the text length of those two properties.
- Adjust base stat auto-configuration to reflect changes in the beta packet if 2e is enabled.
- Update epic tier weapon damage and recovery scaling to use flat 10/20/30 bonuses if 2e is enabled.
- Update conditions if 2e is enabled.
    - Add new Charmed and Frenzied conditions.
    - Update Vulnerable, Confused, Stunned and Hindered conditions.
- Rename `daily` to `arc` if 2e is enabled.
    - Note: macros will continue to use the internal name `daily`, but the UI will show the new name.
- Support 2e style breath weapon spells if 2e enabled.
    - Disable recently added breath reminder.
    - Automatically add E.D. to breath spell's crit range.
- Add a character flag to automate the barbarian's Grim Determination if 2e is enabled.
- Add fields for bonuses to each ability score skill check to magic items.
- Also add magic items bonus to disengage checks to initiative if 2e is enabled.
- Support up to 5 special rolls in monster actions.
- Rename `Omega` tier to `Iconic`.
- Move death save failures and all resource resets from combat deletion to rests; 'skulls' only reset down to 1 if 2e is enabled.
- Add 11th level field to powers.
- Add modifier (alt) to use powers at +1 level.
- Add `Associated Icon` field to magic items.
- Add `Reroll vs. AC` and `Reroll Save` bonuses to magic items, and automate their tracking and usage on a new character sheet panel.
- Move disengage to defenses panel and bonus to settings.
- Add dialog to easily specify circumstantial disengage penalties when engaged to multiple foes.
- Auto-set additional class (custom) resources if 2e enabled.
- Adjust 2e ability scores hint.
- Automate combat rhythm rolling 2d20 when using a maneuver of the correct type.

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed and reworked a previous feature that auto-sets token size on monster size change.
- Updated character sheets to display even level spell rows on powers if 2e is enabled and they're not empty.
- Fixed the Active Effect's disengage modifier being applied to the wrong property under the hood.

## Features
- Parse the `always` content for something like `Retain focus: <N>-<M>`
  - If present, recognize natural rolls in that range and do not change the focus value.
  - Highlight the output chat card's "always" field if this has happened.
