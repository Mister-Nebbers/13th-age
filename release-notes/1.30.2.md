## Bug Fixes
- Fixed several bugs related to Foundry v12:
    - Disegage checks now take into account bonuses, modifiers and Active Effects modifying them.
    - Skill checks now work again.
- Fixed powers not being rollable to chat from npcs (for the rare ones that use them).
- Added missing `_id` to several SRD monster entries, which can no longer hide from the gaze of our compendium browser.
